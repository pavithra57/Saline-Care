When the saline solution (electrolyte) in the bottleis emptied, backflow of blood occurs into the intravenous nerve causing certain unpleasant feelings to the patient sometimes resulting in fits. The pandemic COVID-19 cases are increasing on a daily basis which becomes harder for the limited number of healthcare workers to treat the patients. To not worry aboutthe regular check on the saline drip, this technique can be taken to the hospitals at this much needed time so that it becomes easier for the workers tomonitor and provide the needy with the correct schedule.
